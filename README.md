# First-Time Git Setup

This repo should help you setup Git for the first time after install and also guide you on how to setup SSH for Git  to Github

#### Note: This guide assumes you have already/ust installed Git on your system

Now that you have Git on your system, you’ll want to do a few things to customize your Git environment. You should have to do these things only once on any given computer; they’ll stick around between upgrades. You can also change them at any time by running through the commands again.
